*** Dfference between .NET Core and .NET Framework desktop application. ***

1:- .NET Framework Application Model includes WinForms, ASP.NET, and WPF, used for developing desktop and web apps, 
	   .NET Core does not support desktop application development, focusing instead on the web, windows mobile, 
	     and windows store with ASP.NET and Windows universal apps.

2:- .NET Framework includes the developer tools, languages, and libraries needed to develop Windows applications,
	  .NET Core is a complete rewrite intended to make it a more flexible, cross-platform, modular approach to application development.

3:- NET Core Apps end users can run locally using Chrome's leading and consistent rendering engine within a Windows Desktop Application.
